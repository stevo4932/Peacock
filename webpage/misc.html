            <h1>Only The Males Are Actually Peacocks</h1>
            <p>The collective term for these birds is peafowl. The males are peacocks and the females are peahens. The babies are called peachicks.</p>

            <h1>THEY CAN FLY, DESPITE THEIR MASSIVE TRAINS</h1>
            <p>A peacockís tail feathers can reach up to six feet long and make up about 60 percent of its body length. Despite these odd proportions, the bird flies just fine, if not very far.   There was no statistically significant difference in flight performance of peacocks with intact tail feathers and those without.</p>

            <h1>THEIR FEATHERS ARE COVERED IN TINY CRYSTAL-LIKE STRUCTURES</h1>
            <p>What makes the peacockís feathers so brilliant? Microscopic ìcrystal-like structuresî that reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how theyíre spaced, resulting in bright fluorescent colors. Hummingbirds and shimmering butterflies have mastered a similar visual effect on their own wings.</p>
